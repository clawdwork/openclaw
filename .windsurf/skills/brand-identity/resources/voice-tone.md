## Writing Principles

✅ "To get started..."

❌ "Click on the button that says Submit"
✅ "Click Submit"
```

### 2. Use Active Voice

```
❌ "The file was uploaded by the system"
✅ "The system uploaded the file"

❌ "Your changes have been saved"
✅ "We saved your changes"
```

### 3. Be Specific

```
❌ "An error occurred"
✅ "We couldn't save your file. Check your internet connection."

❌ "Something went wrong"
✅ "Payment failed. Your card was declined."
```

### 4. Be Human

```
❌ "Invalid input detected in field 'email'"
✅ "Please enter a valid email address"

```
