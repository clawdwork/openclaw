## 8. Brand Identity / Complete Project Workflow

A complete brand identity generation project follows this ChatGPT + image gen workflow:

### Step 1: Define the Concept

Establish brand positioning, target audience, setting, and quality tier.

### Step 2: Create a Prompt Formula

Build a reusable template with fill-in-the-blank slots:

```
Capture an epic [type of photography] of the [specific location or object],
showcasing [desired style or detail] in [location]. Use a [camera model]
and [lens model], setting [resolution], [ISO], and [shutter speed].
Frame to include [features] and [surrounding landscape] under [weather].
Direct [lighting] to emphasize [color/effect], underscoring [atmosphere].
```

### Step 3: Generate Variations

Feed the formula + brand brief to the LLM to produce multiple prompt variations for:

- Hero/establishing shots (drone, wide angle)
- Interior/exterior details
- Product close-ups
- People/lifestyle shots
- Food/beverage (if applicable)
- Ambiance/mood shots

### Step 4: Maintain Consistency

Across all generated images, keep these constant:

- Camera body + lens (e.g., `Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM`)
- Lighting direction and quality
- Color palette / warmth
- Architectural/environmental style language

### Step 5: Iterate Per Category

For each asset category, adjust only the subject and framing while keeping the brand formula intact. This produces a cohesive visual identity across dozens of images.

## Platform-Specific Ad Considerations

### TikTok / Reels (Vertical 9:16)

- Hook in first 1-2 seconds — dramatic visual or surprising element
- Fast pacing, bold colors, high energy
- Text overlays and dynamic transitions
- Surreal or comedic hooks perform well

### YouTube Shorts (Vertical 9:16)

- Slightly more cinematic than TikTok
- Can sustain longer builds (5-8 seconds)
- Sound design matters more (YouTube viewers often have audio on)

### Instagram Feed (Square 1:1 or 4:5)

- Clean, polished aesthetic
- Strong composition — works as a still frame too
- Brand consistency across multiple posts

### Brand Video (Landscape 16:9)

- Full cinematic treatment
- Longer builds, more sophisticated pacing
- Premium sound design
- Multiple shot types (establish → detail → hero → close)
