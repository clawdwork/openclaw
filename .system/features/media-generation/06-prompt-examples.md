## Video Prompt Examples

### Epic Action Scene

```
A vast, desolate plain under a stormy, overcast sky. A hundred armed men stand
in formation, breath misting in the cold air, eyes fixed forward. Across the
empty field, a colossal silverback gorilla sits cross-legged in meditation —
still, silent, unmoved. Wind stirs the dust between them. Camera cranes high
to show the vast distance, then cuts low to the charging men — sprinting as
one, weapons raised, faces fierce. Dust kicks up with each pounding step.
Smash cut: the gorilla, eyes closed, breath calm, utterly still. Final shot:
camera arcs slowly around him as the roar of the charging army builds —
thunderous, unstoppable — yet he does not move. The embodiment of calm
before the storm.
```

### Character Introduction (with dialogue)

```
A bustling New York City sidewalk bathed in warm late-afternoon light. A lanky
young man walks stiffly, hunched deeply over a smartphone in one hand. His
other hand grips a nearly-melted iced coffee cup, condensation dripping onto
his cargo shorts. He wears a faded black t-shirt with a cracked white ribcage
design and baggy, sun-faded khaki shorts. Perched crookedly on his head is a
beat-up white captain's hat with yellow trim. His pale blue eyes squint behind
oversized glasses that hang halfway off his face. As the camera tracks him, he
stops abruptly, looks up from his phone, stares blankly toward the lens. After
a beat, in a slow, puzzled tone, he says with a slightly high pitch and raspy
tone: What does banned mean? The city swirls around him — honking cars,
pedestrians, chatter — but he stays frozen, locked in his strange, wandering world.
```

### Sci-Fi / Fantasy Duel

```
Atop a rocky cliff under a stormy sky, two battle-worn wizards in tattered
cloaks charge toward each other, spell glyphs glowing on their arms. The
camera circles them as they cast mid-sprint — glowing runes fling from their
hands like whips of fire and lightning. One ducks beneath a searing arc of
energy and counters with a sweeping blast that explodes against stone. They
close the distance, hurling spells in rapid, practiced motions like trained
fighters. One parries a hex with his forearm glyph, then slams his palm into
the ground — a wall of rock erupts to block the next strike. Magic as warfare,
fast and physical.
```

### Continuity Chain (Shot 1 → Shot 2)

**Shot 1:**

```
Inside a massive, darkened industrial chamber suspended over an endless abyss —
steam vents hiss and machinery hums in the distance. Metal catwalks stretch like
veins through the gloom. A lone figure stands at the end of a narrow walkway,
igniting a crimson plasma blade with a sharp snap-hiss. Across the gap, a blue
blade flares to life in response. The camera glides wide, showing their
silhouettes framed by the cold blue glow of massive reactor cores. They
approach cautiously. Each footstep clangs against steel, echoing into the void.
```

**Shot 2 (continuity prompt):**

```
The duel continues — deeper into the heart of the vast industrial chamber.
Two warriors battle along a narrow maintenance bridge high above a chasm of
glowing reactor coils. The red-blade fighter presses forward with relentless
force, each strike heavy, sparking against the defender's swift counters. The
camera tracks from behind as they clash, spinning and retreating along the
catwalk — boots pounding against metal, the hum of the blades rising to a
shriek. Steam jets blast upward as they exchange a flurry of strikes.
```

### Comedy / Viral

```
POV from a slightly shaky handheld camera, bobbing gently as a tall, fuzzy
purple Sasquatch walks through a wooded trail. It raises the camera slightly,
glancing into the lens. In a dry voice: The other Sasquatches wonder why I'm
purple. The camera pans sideways, revealing two brown Sasquatches in the
distance, frozen mid-step behind bushes, clearly pretending not to watch. One
whispers to the other: Is that thing filming again? The purple Sasquatch
pauses, lowers the camera a bit, then mutters: They're just haters. Turns the
camera back to its own face. It's called branding, Jerry, it says, unfazed,
continuing down the path.
```

### Product Ad — Skincare

```
A frosted glass serum bottle stands on raw concrete as soft light spills through
a linen curtain. The camera glides sideways, revealing condensation forming
delicately on the glass. Airborne mist drifts in slow motion. Light piano keys
echo faintly in the background. Palette: warm cream, translucent white, soft grey.
```

### Product Ad — Tech

```
An AI home assistant orb glides forward on a mirrored floor in a dark cube room.
The camera follows from above at a 45-degree angle. Its LEDs animate with a
flowing pattern. Sub-bass pulses sync with the light. Minimal and precise.
```

### Cinematic Pool Scene (with dialogue)

```
A cinematic night-time scene: a glamorous woman with an afro and gold jewellery
shares a luxurious outdoor pool with a calm alligator. Classical statues and
large blue ceramic vases frame the space, all dimly lit. The camera starts at
water level and slowly zooms toward the woman's face as she meets the lens with
unwavering gaze. Candlelight shimmers across the water; a subtle fill light
outlines her features. Deep slate grey, ocean blue, and warm gold dominate the
palette. Soft ambient electronic music plays, punctuated by gentle ripples. She
says: I'm not afraid of anything… except Sundays without drama. No subtitles.
```

### Space / Epic Scale

```
Giant mothership descending from Earth's atmosphere, slowly, appearing through
the clouds above a massive dystopian city, the camera following the mothership.
It begins as a distant silhouette — immense, silent, and monolithic — emerging
through a roiling layer of storm clouds lit by distant lightning. As it descends,
the camera rises from the city below in a slow, upward spiral, circling the
vessel as it breaches the cloud cover. Its surface is matte-black, angular,
covered in blinking red beacons and massive intake vents that exhale bursts of
pressurized steam. The city below is a decaying sprawl of brutalist towers and
tangled skyways, bathed in the orange-red glow of emergency lighting. No cuts —
just a seamless upward tracking shot spiraling around an unstoppable arrival.
```

### Animation / Absurdist

```
Inside a lava-lit hell café, a hulking demon with curling horns and an apron
labeled "Brewed in Pain" slams a demonic espresso machine onto a molten counter.
Camera sweeps low as he snarls: Alright, you wanted it strong — double hell
roast, no foam, no mercy. Flames erupt as he slams a mug down. He glares at a
cowering imp customer and adds: If your tongue survives, you get a loyalty stamp.
Fiery steam hisses upward as the mug screeches on the stone surface.
```
