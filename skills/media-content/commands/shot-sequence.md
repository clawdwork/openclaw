# Shot Sequence

Plan a multi-shot sequence for a concept or scene.

## Usage

```
plan a multi-shot sequence for [concept]
create a shot list for [scene]
design a video sequence for [brief]
```

## Workflow

1. Read `media-content/video-prompting/SKILL.md` for video prompt structure
2. Read `media-content/character-consistency/SKILL.md` for continuity protocol
3. Break the concept into individual shots (typically 3-5 for a short sequence)
4. For each shot, define: camera angle, camera movement, action beats, audio
5. Create Visual Character Sheets for all recurring characters
6. Apply "Every Prompt is an Island" rule — each shot prompt is fully self-contained
7. Repeat full character descriptors, environment details, and lighting in every shot
8. Vary ONLY the action and camera between shots
9. Define Visual Anchors that tie the sequence together
10. Present each shot as a complete, independent prompt ready for execution
11. Save sequence plan to `~/org/shared/projects/{project}/media/prompts/`
