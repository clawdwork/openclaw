# Character Sheet

Build a Master Descriptor for a recurring character.

## Usage

```
build a character descriptor for [character]
create a character sheet for [name]
design a character for [project]
```

## Workflow

1. Read `media-content/character-consistency/SKILL.md` for Master Descriptor Protocol
2. Gather character details from user (or analyze reference image)
3. Create Visual Character Sheet: age, face, hair, eyes, expression, wardrobe, props, marks, posture
4. If video: create Vocal Character Sheet: voice quality, tone, pace, accent, patterns
5. Define Visual Anchors: color motif, signature prop, lighting pattern
6. Generate a test image using the descriptor to verify consistency
7. Save character sheet to `~/org/shared/projects/{project}/media/characters/{name}.md`
8. Instruct user: this descriptor must be copy-pasted verbatim into every prompt featuring this character
