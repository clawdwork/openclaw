## Video Prompts

### Epic Action Scene

```
A vast, desolate plain under a stormy sky. A hundred armed men in formation,
breath misting. Across the field, a colossal silverback gorilla sits
cross-legged in meditation. Wind stirs the dust. Camera cranes high to show
the distance, then cuts low to the charging men — sprinting, weapons raised.
Dust kicks up. Smash cut: the gorilla, eyes closed, utterly still. Camera
arcs slowly around him as the roar of the army builds. The embodiment of
calm before the storm.
```

### Character Introduction (with dialogue)

```
A bustling New York sidewalk in warm late-afternoon light. A lanky young man
walks stiffly, hunched over a smartphone. His other hand grips a melted iced
coffee. He wears a faded black t-shirt with a cracked ribcage design and
baggy khaki shorts. A beat-up white captain's hat sits crooked on his head.
Pale blue eyes squint behind oversized glasses. He stops abruptly, looks up,
stares blankly. In a slow, puzzled, slightly high and raspy tone he says:
What does banned mean? The city swirls around him but he stays frozen.
```

### Sci-Fi Duel

```
Atop a rocky cliff under a stormy sky, two battle-worn wizards in tattered
cloaks charge each other, spell glyphs glowing on their arms. Camera circles
as they cast mid-sprint — glowing runes fling like whips of fire and
lightning. One ducks beneath a searing arc and counters with a sweeping
blast against stone. They close the distance hurling spells in rapid
practiced motions. One parries with a forearm glyph, then slams his palm
into the ground — a wall of rock erupts. Magic as warfare, fast and physical.
```

### Comedy / Viral

```
POV from a slightly shaky handheld camera, a tall fuzzy purple Sasquatch
walks through a wooded trail. It raises the camera slightly. In a dry voice
it says: The other Sasquatches wonder why I'm purple. Camera pans sideways
revealing two brown Sasquatches frozen behind bushes. One whispers: Is that
thing filming again? The purple Sasquatch mutters: They're just haters.
Turns camera back to its face and says unfazed: It's called branding, Jerry.
Continues down the path.
```

### Product Ad — Skincare

```
A frosted glass serum bottle stands on raw concrete as soft light spills
through a linen curtain. Camera glides sideways revealing condensation
forming on the glass. Airborne mist drifts in slow motion. Light piano keys
echo faintly. Palette: warm cream, translucent white, soft grey.
```

### Product Ad — Tech

```
An AI home assistant orb glides forward on a mirrored floor in a dark cube
room. Camera follows from above at 45 degrees. LEDs animate with flowing
pattern. Sub-bass pulses sync with the light. Minimal and precise.
```

### Cinematic Pool Scene (with dialogue)

```
Cinematic night scene: a glamorous woman with an afro and gold jewellery
shares a luxurious outdoor pool with a calm alligator. Classical statues
and large blue ceramic vases frame the space, dimly lit. Camera starts at
water level and slowly zooms toward her face. She meets the lens with
unwavering gaze. Candlelight shimmers across water. Subtle fill light
outlines her features. Deep slate grey, ocean blue, warm gold palette.
Soft ambient electronic music, gentle ripples. She says: I'm not afraid of
anything except Sundays without drama. No subtitles.
```

### Continuity Chain (Shot 1 → Shot 2)

**Shot 1:**

```
Inside a massive, darkened industrial chamber suspended over an endless abyss —
steam vents hiss and machinery hums in the distance. Metal catwalks stretch like
veins through the gloom. A lone figure stands at the end of a narrow walkway,
igniting a crimson plasma blade with a sharp snap-hiss. Across the gap, a blue
blade flares to life in response. The camera glides wide, showing their
silhouettes framed by the cold blue glow of massive reactor cores. They
approach cautiously. Each footstep clangs against steel, echoing into the void.
```

**Shot 2 (continuity prompt):**

```
The duel continues — deeper into the heart of the vast industrial chamber.
Two warriors battle along a narrow maintenance bridge high above a chasm of
glowing reactor coils. The red-blade fighter presses forward with relentless
force, each strike heavy, sparking against the defender's swift counters. The
camera tracks from behind as they clash, spinning and retreating along the
catwalk — boots pounding against metal, the hum of the blades rising to a
shriek. Steam jets blast upward as they exchange a flurry of strikes.
```

### Animation / Absurdist

```
Inside a lava-lit hell café, a hulking demon with curling horns and an apron
labeled "Brewed in Pain" slams a demonic espresso machine onto a molten counter.
Camera sweeps low as he snarls: Alright, you wanted it strong — double hell
roast, no foam, no mercy. Flames erupt as he slams a mug down. He glares at a
cowering imp customer and adds: If your tongue survives, you get a loyalty stamp.
Fiery steam hisses upward as the mug screeches on the stone surface.
```

### Space / Epic Scale

```
Giant mothership descending from Earth's atmosphere, slowly appearing
through clouds above a massive dystopian city. Camera follows the ship,
beginning as a distant silhouette through roiling storm clouds lit by
lightning. As it descends, camera rises in a slow upward spiral. Surface is
matte-black, angular, covered in blinking red beacons and massive intake
vents exhaling pressurized steam. The city below is decaying brutalist
towers and tangled skyways bathed in orange-red emergency lighting. No cuts —
seamless upward tracking shot spiraling around an unstoppable arrival.
